# Covid-19 (Coronovirus) analysis

## Overview
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Covid-19 (a.k.a. new coronavirus) a pandemic. Since January 22, 2020, the Johns Hopkins CSSE maintains a [data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) to track the Covid-19 incidence worldwide. In order to understand a little bit how this disease will affect my country (Brazil), I performed some data analysis in this data.

For Portuguese speakers, I wrote a post in my blog about this analysis: [O que os dados dizem sobre o Coronav√≠rus?](http://computacaointeligente.com.br/coolstuffs/analisando-coronavirus/)

## Some plots and tables got during the analysis (updated on March 26, 2020)
### Covid-19 worldwide (without China):

## Running the code
The analysis was coded in Python using Jupyter Notebook. To install the requirement:

`pip install requirements.txt `

First, run the `get_data.ipynb` script to get the most updated data from the [Johns Hopkins repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

Next, run the `analysis.ipynb` code and have fun
